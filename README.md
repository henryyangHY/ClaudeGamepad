## Screenshots

### Button Mapping

Configure your controller with an intuitive visual editor. All buttons are grouped by region—shoulders, face buttons, navigation, and system controls—for quick scanning and reassignment.

## Default Button Mapping

| Button (Xbox / PS5) | Action |
|----------------------|--------|
| A / ✕ | Enter (confirm) |
| B / ○ | Ctrl+C (interrupt) |
| X / □ | Accept (y + Enter) |
| Y / △ | Reject (n + Enter) |
| D-pad | Arrow keys |
| LB / L1 | Tab (autocomplete) |
| RB / R1 | Escape |
| L3 / R3 Press | Voice input |
| Start / Options | Preset menu |
| Select / Create | `/clear` |
| LT / L2 + Face | Quick prompt (configurable) |
| RT / R2 + Face | Quick prompt (configurable) |
| LT+RT / L2+R2 | Command mode (combo input) |
| LT + RT + Select | Quit |

All mappings are fully customizable in Settings.

> **Note:** macOS reserves the hardware Guide / Home / PS button. If you want to open Vibe Island or another overlay from the controller, map any capturable button to the `Combo` action instead.

## Installation

### Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- A game controller (Xbox, PS5 DualSense, or MFi compatible)
- For Whisper (optional): `brew install whisper-cpp`

### Option A: .app Bundle (Recommended)

Build a proper macOS app bundle that lives in `/Applications/` and can auto-launch on login — no terminal required after the first build.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xargin/ClaudeGamepad.git
cd ClaudeGamepad
./build-app.sh
cp -R ClaudeGamepad.app /Applications/
```

Then open the app once and grant **Accessibility** when prompted.

**Auto-launch on login:** System Settings → General → Login Items → add ClaudeGamepad.

> **Note:** Every time you rebuild and copy a new binary to `/Applications/`, macOS will revoke the existing Accessibility grant. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, toggle ClaudeGamepad off and back on after each update.

### Option B: Build from Source (CLI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xargin/ClaudeGamepad.git
cd ClaudeGamepad
swift build -c release
# Binary at .build/release/ClaudeGamepad
```

### Run (CLI)

```bash
swift run
```

Or build and copy to your PATH:

```bash
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/ClaudeGamepad /usr/local/bin/
```

## First Launch

1. Open `ClaudeGamepad.app` (or run `swift run` for CLI mode)
2. If Accessibility is not granted, the menu bar icon shows **「⚠️ Grant Accessibility to enable buttons」** — click it to jump directly to System Settings
3. Grant **Accessibility** permission (needed for keyboard simulation)
4. Grant **Speech Recognition** permission if using voice input
5. Connect your controller — the menu bar icon turns active
6. Focus your terminal running Claude Code
7. Start pressing buttons!

## Usage

### Basic Controls

| Action | Controller Input |
|--------|------------------|
| Navigate code | D-pad |
| Accept suggestion | X / □ |
| Reject suggestion | Y / △ |
| Trigger autocomplete | LB / L1 |
| Cancel / Interrupt | B / ○ |
| Send / Confirm | A / ✕ |

### Voice Input

1. Press **L3 / R3** (stick click)
2. Floating HUD shows "Listening..." with a live waveform
3. Speak your prompt (auto-detects Chinese and English)
4. HUD shows transcription with confirm/cancel options
5. Press **A / ✕** to paste to terminal, or **B / ○** to cancel

### Quick Prompts

Hold a trigger (LT or RT) and press a face button for instant commands:

| Trigger | Button | Command |
|---------|--------|---------|
| LT | A | `showtime` |
| LT | B | `fix the failing tests` |
| LT | X | `continue` |
| LT | Y | `undo the last change` |
| RT | A | `run the tests` |
| RT | B | `show me the diff` |
| RT | X | `looks good, commit this` |
| RT | Y | `add types and documentation` |

### Command Combos

Hold both triggers (LT+RT) to enter command mode. Input directional sequences to trigger actions:

**Helldivers 2 style** (D-pad only):
- ↑ ↓ → ← ↑ → "Reinforce" command

**Fighting game style** (D-pad + button):
- ↓ → A → "Hadouken" style action

## Configuration

Click the menu bar icon > **Settings** to open the settings window. The settings panel uses a dark-themed card layout with five tabs.

### General

Choose your **controller style** — Xbox or PS5. This changes all button labels and colors across the UI, overlays, and settings panels.

### Button Mapping

All button bindings organized by region: Shoulders, Face Buttons, Navigation, and System & Sticks. Each button has a dropdown to pick its action. LT/RT (L2/R2) serve as modifier keys, so their quick prompts are managed in the Preset Prompts tab. If you assign a button to `Combo`, the row expands to show the keyboard shortcut used to open an overlay window.

### Preset Prompts

The left panel lists all quick prompt slots (LT+A, LT+B, RT+A, etc.); the right panel is a focused editor. Each slot can use a preset prompt or custom text, with live character count and preview.

**Default Quick Prompts:**

| Trigger | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| LT + A | showtime |
| LT + B | fix the failing tests |
| LT + X | continue |
| LT + Y | undo the last change |
| RT + A | run the tests |
| RT + B | show me the diff |
| RT + X | looks good, commit this |
| RT + Y | add types and documentation |

### Command Combos

Hold both triggers (LT+RT / L2+R2) to enter command mode. Input directional sequences to trigger preset prompts — two styles available:

- **Helldivers 2** — D-pad only sequences (e.g. ↑ ↓ → ← ↑ for "Reinforce")
- **Fighting Game** — D-pad + face button finisher (e.g. ↓ → A for "Hadouken")

A button-based input editor lets you build sequences by clicking, no Unicode typing needed. The settings UI detects and warns about prefix conflicts between combos.

### Speech Recognition

A top-level Voice Pipeline status bar shows engine, binary install state, model status, and LLM cleanup toggle at a glance. Below are two cards:

- **Whisper Local** — select a model (tiny 75MB to large-v3 3.1GB), one-click install binary, one-click download model
- **LLM Refinement** — configure API URL, API Key, and model name; works with Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Voice Input Flow

1. Press **L3 / R3** (stick click)
2. Floating HUD shows "Listening..." with a live waveform
3. Speak your prompt (auto-detects Chinese and English)
4. HUD shows transcription with confirm/cancel options
5. Press **A / ✕** to paste to terminal, or **B / ○** to cancel

## Vibe Island / Overlay Navigation

Use this when you want a controller button to open a keyboard-driven overlay such as Vibe Island.

1. In **Settings > Button Mapping**, assign any spare button to the `Combo` action.
2. Configure the keyboard shortcut for that action in the Guide Key Combo controls. The default is `⌘G`.
3. Trigger that button to open the overlay.
4. For a short window after the overlay opens, D-pad arrows are routed to the frontmost overlay app instead of your terminal.
5. If you click back into your terminal, the app stops reclaiming focus and arrow input returns to the terminal path.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The controller opens Vibe Island but D-pad does nothing**
> Make sure Accessibility permission is granted and the overlay is actually frontmost after the combo fires.

**Q: The terminal loses focus after using an overlay**
> Current builds stop routing arrows to the overlay as soon as you manually switch back to the terminal.

**Q: The physical Guide / Home / PS button does not trigger anything**
> This is a macOS limitation. Bind another button to `Combo` and use that button to launch the overlay shortcut.

**Q: Voice input is not working**
> Check that Speech Recognition permission is granted in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Speech Recognition. For better quality, install whisper.cpp with `brew install whisper-cpp`.

**Q: Controller not detected**
> Make sure your controller is Mac-compatible. Xbox and PS5 controllers work best. MFi controllers should work but may have limited button support.

**Q: Buttons stop working after I update the app**
> macOS invalidates the Accessibility grant whenever the app binary is replaced. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, toggle ClaudeGamepad off and back on.

**Q: The menu bar shows ⚠️ Grant Accessibility to enable buttons**
> Click that menu item to jump directly to the Accessibility settings page, then add or re-enable ClaudeGamepad.
